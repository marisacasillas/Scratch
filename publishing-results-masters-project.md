# Publishing Masters thesis and/or internship work

The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines that will help you, the master's student/intern, understand what to anticipate when it comes to publishing findings from your work in an academic journal.

## During the thesis/internship

Academic supervisors are expected to:

- provide clear guidelines about what work needs to be done, how, and to what standard
- make sure the student develops a realistic work plan for the planned project period
- check in frequently to ensure that the project is on track and, if not, to adapt the work plan accordingly
- provide necessary access to tools, readings, and learning experiences in a timely manner
- plan the work such that the student has true opportunities to learn about the research process
- give guidance on good writing practices and clear writing style on written reports of the work
- adhere to all formal duties for supervision, as specified by the your and their institution(s)
- give opportunities for you to make intellectual contributions if the agreed-upon aim of your work experience is to attempt publishing the findings in a journal article

You (the student/intern) are expected to:

- carry out your work in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the academic supervisors
- keep daily notes on all doubts, decisions, and progress
- share your notes with supervisors at regular meetings (this can be a weekly/daily update email)
- complete the work in a timely manner
- ensure that all required institutional forms (e.g., registration) are processed on time
- give the supervisors adequate time to review and/or sign any required institutional forms (usually 2â€“3 weeks is adequate)
- make supervisors aware of all relevant institutional deadlines for your thesis/internship well in advance of those dates (1 month)

## Publishing the research project

Toward the end of the internship, you and your academic supervisor(s) should meet to discuss the possibility of publishing the research project. Publication may be your collective intention from the beginning of the project, but actually _proceeding_ with writing up and submitting the paper is not guaranteed until you and your academic supervisor(s) agree together on a final set of guidelines.

BOTH at the beginning of the research project, and again toward the end, the committee should discuss the following topics:

- does the student/intern want to pursue a career in academia?
- where does the idea for the research project come from?
- where do the research tasks and their guidelines (e.g., for data collection, annotation, and analysis) come from?
- how likely are the findings to be of interest to the broader academic community in their present form?
- will you realistically have enough time to work on the article in the months after your internship/study ends?

You will only be a co-author on the publication if the following conditions are met:

- the study does not require significant work in order to be considered publishable, even after your contributions are complete (e.g., no further data collection/annotation/analysis is needed)
- you have made intellectual contributions to the research
- you take primary writing responsibility (you make the plan, write substantial portions, and assign tasks to others)
- you ensure that the work is submitted to a journal within **four** months of the end of your internship/study
- you continue to be responsive to feedback and reminders from your supervisor(s) until the work is published

If you is unable to sustain these conditions, your contribution will be acknowledged as a non-author in future journal publications using the work. Changes to these guidelines can be agreed upon by the supervisor(s) in exceptional circumstances, but must be documented elsewhere.
