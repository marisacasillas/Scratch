# Bridging the Digital Divide: Teaching for Equity and Empathy in the Wake of COVID-19 (Jessica Calarco, Sociology)

Presented via Zoom from Indiana University Bloomington to over 600 ptcps

They will send a curated list of the questions that people submitted to participants so that people can conduct similar discussions locally. Same with the chat entries from the webinar as well as a recording of the session for sharing the content in general.

## Digital divide?
The ubiquity of devices like cell phones and laptops make it seem like there's no digital divide, but these devices may be more crucial for vulerable students (e.g., 1st gen, low income, students of color) who have fewer reliable devices and less reliable internet access >> these breakdowns in tech lead to lower grades and hier stress in Calarco's research. Worried that these same students also won't feel comfortable reaching out and asking for help.

This webinar is focusing on course policies/requirements and expectations that can be changed to help minimize harm.

### Example study by Calarco et al.
* 800 students surveyed and participated in focus groups at a large public university from diverse SES backgrounds
* key questions:
    * who struggles to access reliably digital technologies?
    * how do those struggles impact grades and health and contribute to larger patterns of equality?
* most students have access to a smartphone and laptop, but the very vulnerable students are less likely to have their _own_ laptop and are less likely to have reliable internet (so, e.g., worry about running out of data) at home compared to their more privileged peers
* these students are also most likely to be personally responsible for paying their technology-related costs or inherit tech second-hand from friends/family (vs. privileged peers, whose parents generally pay for things); see also "Paying the Price" by Sara Goldrick-Rab
* the devices they have are consequently also older, slower, and more problem-prone on average; simply having access to a laptop/phone does not imply equal access to functional computing environments
* means these students also experience more frequent and longer disruptions in their access to technology (e.g., when devices break), leading them to need to borrow others' equipment, use on-campus resources, or to make-do otherwise; disruptions can last days to months for these vulnerable students, whereas privileged students are looking at hours to days of disruption
* more frequent disruptions were associated with lower reported grades and higher stress levels; leaves low-income students vulnerable to academic and social consequences
* **this may be felt more accutely as students are forced to move online since students can no longer access campus computer labs or wifi**
* [gives some specific case examples in video]


## Scope of the problem

Lots of students may be affected, especially at big schools: **9%** of students at IU who managed to participate in an online survey reported not having sufficient wifi access at their home to do online coursework

Vulnerable students appear to be reluctant to ask profs/admins for help (also Calarco research)---low students are afraid of being stigmatized of punished for asking for help in these situations. They don't trust that the university will be responsive to their needs.

> It's not these students' job to fix the problem by asking for help; the campus closure problems are on top of a number of other issues these vulnerable students are already facing (e.g., paying tuition) and go beyond technology problems (e.g., having a place to stay off campus).

### Empathy gap
e.g., Requiring attendance synchronously or asynchronously or doing an online exam, if it were the case that not all students had equal access to the appropriate devices.

## What do we do?

1. Do more to ensure that students actually have access to the devices, wifi, etc. they need, including both devices and tech support (don't assume all young people are tech savvy; exposure to tech is also unequal).
2. We need to adjust our expectations about what can reasonably get done. If we don't adjust expectations and extend our capacity for forgiveness, we risk grading students on their privilege.
3. Make universal accommodations; offering flexibility that students can access without needing to ask for the accommodations
4. Offering individual flexibility to students who need it (e.g., for whom even universal accommodations are insufficient)

### Examples of these actions in her class (~250 freshmen/sophomores)
1. Staying in contact with students, offering them words of reassurance, and sending information about resources (e.g., housing, food, tech, academic, coping) [she reads aloud part of her letter to students]
2. No student will end up with a grade lower than what they had when classes shifted from live to online, and students will have the opportunity to switch to pass/fail if they want
3. Universal accommodations (still not equitable or enough for everyone)
    - Optional attendance, options for participation, optional assignments, flexible projects/exams, recordings of course times with captions; not forcing students to show they "deserve" support
    - All remaining minor assignments (activity reflections in class, reading quizzes) are now optional
    - Students can choose to do a group project or do an online exam for the final exam (she argues that in normal "on campus" times online exams with open books/notes might be more equitable anyway)
    - Detailed study guide that they are encouraged to collaboratively complete (e.g., over Google Docs)
    - Adjusted her grading scale for the semester to accommodate these changes and made it very clear to students
4. Reach out and offer support to individuals who need it, e.g., if the student has done enough so far in your view, and is unable to shift to online learning, letting them off the hook for the rest of the semester with their current grade

## Q & A (pre-vetted)

### What are the best practices for remote education from an equity perspective?
We can't just rely on the practices that have already been developed by professionals who work with students who KNOW they are going to learn online. So we have to think out of the box a bit and see where we need to adapt. The key is to set reasonable expectations, give students as many options as possible for participating and engaging, and minimizing extra work (for ourselves and our students). Be empathetic and patient! And just don't _require_ synchronous participation.

### How can we adjust our expectations around assignments that have previously been part of the class?
This is a real challenge to instructors who have developed assignments they're attached to, but we have to be careful about putting too much on students (and ourselves) right now---consider cutting assignments that aren't critical, giving longer windows for completion (to account for asynchronous participation), making some assignments optional (e.g., allowing students to substitute them for a lower grade they got previously in the semester)

### How to do assessment online in a (more) equitable way?
A few semesters ago, Calarco stopped doing in-class exams after talking to a student who had to take a make-up exam because of a death in the family. Afterward, she told Calarco that it was the best exam-taking of her life; sitting elbow-to-elbow in in-class exams made her test-taking anxiety worse, normally, and she enjoyed having space to herself during the exam. For students with mental health issues, in-class exames may simply not be equitable. So choose your place, choose your precise timing (e.g., complete within a 72-hour window, etc.). Required a change in test design, grading policy, and the creation of a giant bank of test questions---stress is reduced, though grades are still pretty well distributed. For **this** semester, it's not guaranteed that they can find a quiet place with good internet to take an online exam, which is why she's offering them the option of doing either the online exam or a group project.

### How can we accommodate students with disabilities and with limited access to technology?
Giving students options for engagement, participation, and exams means students don't have to come to you for additional accommodations. Having the downloadable transcript is a good idea (text-based _and_ low-bandwidth) and/or putting your lecture notes up with your lecture slides. Reach out proactively to students who you already know may need individual accommodations?

### Do universal accommodations give too many advantages to students who don't need them?
We can't avoid this issue without taking these benefits away from the students who really need them; our focus is to focus on minimizing penalization in this moment and not in preventing privileged students from taking advantage.

### How can we make students accountable for not completing assigned work?
This is such a time of uncertainty for us and for the students, and our goal should be to try and minimize further harm. If a student stopped showing up, it'd be easy to assume they were slacking off. But those students may be struggling and in need of empathy and offers of help (e.g., offering them a grade based on the work they already completed).

### How can we support students who face new challenges and responsibilities?
Students may be facing new childcare, work, family, housing/food insecurity challenges in pair with their academic challenges. And may well continue to have these challenges in the economic fallout after the pandemic. Check into resources that your university is offering for students (many may be linked into those long, URL-full emails from your uni). Compile the useful ones and send them on to students who need the info and/or post it on your course webpage, check in with students individually and ask them how they are doing.

### What resources are available for students who are struggling with access to tech?
For students who don't have internet access at home they may quality for low-cost high-speed internet (e.g., internetessentials.com via Comcast ~$10/mo, AT&T digitalU program; typically require application and proof of qualification for other government programs like food stamps, which college students often don't qualify for because they don't work enough). IU is also setting up drive-in internet in parking lots around the state ("hot spot lots"). Devices are a little trickier (missed first option—check the recording; "Fast Funds" program for indiv faculty members to distribute to students for small individual financial needs).

## Q & A (from live chat)

### Is there ever a time when you say that a particular class is simply not appropriate for online delivery? (e.g., skill-based courses)
We have to re-think what it means to do instruction in many circumstances, and this can mean putting information out there without expecting anything back (e.g., seeing chem lab happen/dance instruction performed) may still allow them to reap some benefits---we have to lower expectations.

### Is there a unified place we can send students who need help (e.g., those who need help with housing, food, mental health)?
Check hope4college.com (Sara Goldrick-Rab) for lots of redirection to resources that vulnerable students may benefit from. For thos in admin, thinking empathetically about financial aid and scholarship implications for changing grading options etc. is important. You can also recommend the crisis text line---they don't need to verbally talk to anyone 741741 a 24/7 resource with free mental health counseling via text and students can be put in touch with low-cost local counselors if needed.

### What about students who aren't staying in the US?
She knows less about this because she hasn't done as much research on this. Not knowing what students have to grapple with in general requires empathy and patience in general.

### How do we foster community in online courses?
Depends on what you've already been doing; reluctant to encourage _new_ things and work to create community that's not there in the spirit of less is more right now. Of course giving students an optional place to make connections is great, but shouldn't be mandatory as a community-building task. You can also encourage students to stay in touch on whatever platforms they feel most comfortable with.

### What is our role in combatting the spread of misinformation during the pandemic?
When we are talking about the pandemic anyway, we should be conveying accurate information and giving students the tools to assess the accuracy of news as it comes at them. In general there are probably multiple natural opportunities to build in critical thinking skills wrt media (also check commonsensemedia.org) with normal course content. IU is considering constructing scripts for faculty who are sharing info with students about COVID-19 to minimize bias/prejudice/misinfomation.

### Do we as educators have a responsibility to push for efforts like net neutrality that are aimed at bridging the digital divide?
Net neutrality can be a lot of things, e.g., rules for internet providers about giving priority to some websites over others and regulating web connectivity such that it is reasonably available for everyone (government service available at the local, regional, or national level of organization; i.e., internet access as a public utility). A good example is that big companies have no incentive to build high-speed networks in rural areas.

## Final thoughts
Our students are going through an incredibly tumultuous time, and this disruption may affect every aspect of the most vulnerable students' lives. Think critically about that and be willing to let go of your standard expectations (hopefully admin will extend this courtesy to faculty). Step back and ask what really needs to get done, what feasibly can get done, give lots of options, and minimize doing more harm.
